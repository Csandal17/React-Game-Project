# PIXELPLAY

## Description

PixelPlay is a collaborative project resulting in the creation of a ReactApp. It is a single page website with three games that we each worked on individually; the Hangman game which was created my Chinedu Igbokwe, the magic 8 ball game created by Chantal Sandal-Guiheen and the Rock Paper Scissors game as well as the design of the project was created by Chris Kennedy.

We created this project because we wanted to create something fun, creative and challenging to build and the three of us loved these 3 classic games. It also gave us an oppurtunity to learn new coding techniques, libraries and packages as well as giving us the oppurtunity to do a group project for the first time and learn more about using Git and feauture branches.

To create this project we had some requirements we had to fulfill:

- Use ReactJS
- Use Node
- use both Get and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
- Deploy using Netlify
- use atleast 2 libraries, packages or technologies
- Have a polished front end/UI

This project was a great learning experience and we feel that after working together have all learned a great deal about working as a group to solve a problem, how to discuss ideas and help eachother and also how to professionally put together a presentation to display our work.
